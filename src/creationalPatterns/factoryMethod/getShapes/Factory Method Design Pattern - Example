Factory Method Design Pattern - Example

TODO:
- Shape Interface
- concrete classes implementing the Shape interface
- ShapeFactory
- FactoryPatternDemo, the demo class, uses ShapeFactory to get a Shape Object. It passes information (CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE) to ShapeFactory to get the type of object it needs.
