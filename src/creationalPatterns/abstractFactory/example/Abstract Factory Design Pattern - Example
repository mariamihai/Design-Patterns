Abstract Factory Design Pattern - Example

- Shape and Color interfaces and concrete classes implementing them
- abstract factory class
- factory classes for shape and color, and each factory extends AbstractFactory
- a factory creator/generator class is created
- AbstractFactoryPatternDemo, demo class, uses FactoryProducer to get an AbstractFactory object. It passes info CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE for Shape and RED / GREEN / BLUE for Color 
to AbstractFactory to get the type of objects it needs
