Creational Patterns

They provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather then instantiating objects directly using new operator.
This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.


Patterns:
- Abstract Factory - creates an instance of several families of classes
- Builder - separates object construction from its representation
- Factory Method - creates an instance of several derived classes
- Object Pool - avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
- Prototype - a fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- Singleton - a class of which only a single instance can exist
