Observer Design Pattern - Example

- 3 actor classes:
	- Subject - object having methods to attach and detach observers to a client object
	- abstract class Observer, concrete class Subject that is extending Observer
	- Client
- ObserverPatternDemo will use Subject and concrete class object to show observer pattern in action.
