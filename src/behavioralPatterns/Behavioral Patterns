Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with communication between objects.

Patterns:
- 			Chain of responsibility - a way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- 			Command - encapsulate a command request as an object
- Interpreter - a way to include language elements in a program
- 			Iterator - sequentially access the elements of a collection
- 			Mediator - defines simplified communication between classes
- 			Memento - capture and restore an object's internal state
- 			Null Object - designed to act as default value of an object
- Observer - a way to notify change to a number of classes
- State - alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- Strategy - encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- Template method - defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a sbuclass
- Visitor - defines a new operation to a class without change
