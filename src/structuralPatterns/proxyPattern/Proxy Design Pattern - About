Proxy Design Pattern - About

INTENT
- provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it
- use an extra level of indirection to support distributed, controlled or intelligent access
- add a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from undue complexity

PROBLEM
You need to support resource-hungry objects and you don't want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually requested by the client.
