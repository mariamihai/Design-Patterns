# Design-Patterns

The project contains the description and at least one example for each pattern tackled.
Each pattern has images to describe it better and the links to the sources.


## Creational Patterns
They provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather then instantiating objects directly using new operator.
This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.

### Patterns
**Abstract Factory** - creates an instance of several families of classes

**Builder** - separates object construction from its representation

**Factory Method** - creates an instance of several derived classes

**Object Pool** - avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use

**Prototype** - a fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

**Singleton** - a class of which only a single instance can exist


## Structural Patterns
These design patterns concern class and object composition.
The concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

### Patterns
**Adapter** - convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect

**Bridge** - decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently

**Composite** - composes objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies

**Decorator** - attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically

**Facade** - wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface

**Flyweight** - todo

**Private Class Data** - todo

**Proxy** - todo


## Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with communication between objects.

### Patterns
**Chain of responsibility** - a way of passing a request between a chain of objects - todo

**Command** - encapsulate a command request as an object - todo

**Interpreter** - a way to include language elements in a program

**Iterator** - sequentially access the elements of a collection - todo

**Mediator** - defines simplified communication between classes - todo

**Memento** - capture and restore an object's internal state - todo

**Null Object** - designed to act as default value of an object - todo

**Observer** - a way to notify change to a number of classes

**State** - alter an object's behavior when its state changes

**Strategy** - encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

**Template method** - defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

**Visitor** - defines a new operation to a class without change


## Completed books
The notes from **Design Patterns Explained**, Second Edition by Alan Shalloway and James R. Trott are added in the root of the project as well.
